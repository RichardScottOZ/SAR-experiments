## Papers
- Deriving Surface Resistivity from Polarimetric SARData Using Dual-Input UNet : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01811.pdf

## Experiments
- Can ChatGPT 3.5 lift an architecture out of a paper
	- likely yes
	- get it right, very little chance
	- 5 tries to correct an error to get an actual 'model'
		- Not a correct model, but a model that doesn't have actual errors

- Produces a different code version
	- Same result of course
